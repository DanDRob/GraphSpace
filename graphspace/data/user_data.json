Alpha generates revenue when a client transacts currency with us. On a monthly basis, a percentage of the total revenue generated by a portfolio manager (PM) is then paid to him/her. The percentage the PM earns is based on 2 things; the PM hitting their \u2018New Business\u2019 target and how long the PM has been at Alpha: What is 'New Business'? The revenue generated for Alpha when a client trades with Alpha for the first time is classified as 'New Business' revenue. Additionally, any revenue generated for Alpha by that client within 30 days of that first trade is also classified as 'New Business'. What is the 'New Business\u2019 target? The monthly 'New Business' target for PM\u2019s is set at \u00a36,000. It remains constant, not changing in line with the PM\u2019s experience or portfolio size. Over 90% of the time, when a client trades for the first time, the relative PM\u2019s \u2018New Business\u2019 target is hit. Having a monthly \u2018New Business\u2019 target that doesn\u2019t change ens...",

      "content": "Below is an English version of the provided description:\n\n---\n\nTo implement the functionalities mentioned in the diagram\u2014such as **rapid inspiration capture**, **AI-enhanced note summarization**, and **efficient note management**\u2014one possible approach is to integrate **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** with **GNN (Graph Neural Networks)** into a unified note system. This integration enables simultaneous work on \u201cnote content generation/summarization\u201d and \u201corganization/management of inter-note relationships.\u201d The following is one overall idea for reference.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Overall System Architecture\n\n1. **Data Acquisition Layer:**  \n   - Users quickly input notes via voice or text (\u201crapid inspiration capture\u201d).  \n   - Voice notes are first converted to text using **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**.  \n   - All note texts and their metadata (e.g., creation time, tags, associated projects) are stored in a database or knowledge base.\n\n2. **Knowledge Representation Layer (Graph-Based):**  \n   - Use a **GNN** to manage and analyze the relationships between notes.  \n   - Each note is considered a **node** in the graph, and notes that reference one another or are semantically similar are connected with **edges**.  \n   - Through GNN\u2019s **node representation learning** and **relationship inference**, functions such as automatic clustering, auto-tagging, and similar note recommendation (\u201cefficient note management\u201d) can be achieved.\n\n3. **Retrieval and Generation Layer (RAG):**  \n   - When a user wants to review, summarize, or query note content, RAG first calls a **retrieval module** (Retriever) to select the most relevant notes from the note library/knowledge base.  \n   - The retrieved content (text or structured information) is then provided as context to a **generation module** (Generator) to produce summaries, minutes, key point extractions, or answer questions (\u201cAI-enhanced note summarization\u201d).\n\n4. **Privacy and Security Layer:**  \n   - The data can be stored in encrypted form or deployed on a local/private cloud, ensuring \u201cdata ownership and privacy.\u201d  \n   - Both GNN and RAG do not mandate that data be hosted on public clouds; related models or retrieval services can be placed on local servers or via private deployment to prevent leakage of sensitive information.\n\n5. **Maintenance and Cleaning Layer:**  \n   - GNN can be used to analyze which notes are rarely accessed, duplicated, or outdated, triggering automatic archiving or deletion (\u201cauto cleaning\u201d).  \n   - Combined with RAG-generated \u201cnote summaries,\u201d the system can decide which notes can be merged or simplified.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Using GNN for Note Management\n\n### 2.1 Constructing the Note Graph\n\n1. **Nodes:**  \n   - Each note corresponds to a node.  \n   - Nodes store properties such as the note text, creation time, tags, and topics.\n\n2. **Edges:**  \n   - If there is an association between two notes (for example, high semantic similarity, belonging to the same project/meeting, or sharing tags), an edge can be established between them.  \n   - Different types of edges (multiple relationships) can be introduced, such as:  \n     - \u201cSimilarity\u201d edge: Connect notes if their similarity exceeds a certain threshold.  \n     - \u201cReference\u201d edge: If note A cites note B.  \n     - \u201cSame topic\u201d edge: When two notes belong to the same topic or category.\n\n3. **Building a Knowledge Graph (Optional):**  \n   - If the notes contain a lot of structured information (e.g., names, locations, dates, events), entities and relationships can be extracted to form a knowledge graph.  \n   - This richer graph structure benefits GNN when performing tasks like node classification, link prediction, and relationship inference.\n\n### 2.2 Functions of the GNN Model\n\n1. **Node Representation Learning:**  \n   - The GNN learns representations of note nodes, automatically discovering which notes are semantically similar.  \n   - These representations can then be used for retrieval, recommendation, or clustering.\n\n2. **Automatic Tagging or Clustering:**  \n   - GNN can be applied for node classification or clustering to automatically tag notes with topics or labels, reducing the need for manual organization.\n\n3. **Recommending Similar Notes:**  \n   - When a user is viewing or editing a note, the system can compute node similarity using the GNN and recommend related notes (e.g., \u201cyou might also be interested in\u2026\u201d).\n\n4. **Automatic Cleaning and Archiving:**  \n   - By evaluating node activity (such as last modified time or access frequency) or \u201cimportance\u201d in the graph (e.g., via PageRank scores), the system can decide whether to archive or delete certain notes.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Using RAG for AI-Enhanced Note Summarization\n\n1. **Retrieval Module (Retriever):**  \n   - This module can use vector retrieval (e.g., Faiss, Milvus) or traditional inverted indexing (e.g., BM25).  \n   - For example, if a user queries, \u201cPlease summarize all notes about Project X from last week,\u201d the system first retrieves the most relevant note texts from the library.  \n   - The retrieval module can also combine GNN-based similarity results to filter notes on a semantic level.\n\n2. **Generation Module (Generator):**  \n   - This module employs large language models (LLMs), such as the GPT series or other Transformer models.  \n   - The retrieved note texts are provided as context to generate a concise and coherent summary or key points to help users quickly review (\u201cAI-enhanced note summarization\u201d).  \n   - Additionally, the module can support QA mode. For instance, if a user asks, \u201cWhat is the core risk in this project?\u201d the model will first retrieve relevant note content and then generate an answer based on that content.\n\n3. **Reducing Hallucination and Ensuring Accuracy:**  \n   - The advantage of the RAG approach is that the generation module relies on real-time retrieved note content, which reduces the likelihood of fabricating information.  \n   - Users can also see links to the source notes in the generated summary, ensuring traceability.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Data Privacy and Security\n\n1. **Local or Privatized Deployment:**  \n   - In enterprise environments or scenarios with personal privacy concerns, GNN, RAG, and the retrieval services can be deployed on local servers or private clouds, ensuring that note data remains within the internal network.\n\n2. **Encrypted Storage:**  \n   - The original note text can be encrypted (using symmetric or asymmetric encryption) so that only the user holds the decryption key.  \n   - This ensures that even if someone gains access to the database, they cannot read the note contents.\n\n3. **Access Control:**  \n   - In an enterprise note system, different departments or roles can be assigned distinct access permissions, and GNN can be used to dynamically identify the scope of these permissions.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Technology Stack and Implementation Recommendations\n\n1. **GNN Framework:**  \n   - Frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric or DGL (Deep Graph Library) are recommended to construct and train the GNN models efficiently.\n\n2. **Retrieval Engines:**  \n   - For vector retrieval: Faiss, Milvus, Elastic Vector Search, etc.  \n   - For traditional retrieval: Elasticsearch, Apache Lucene, BM25, etc.\n\n3. **Generation Model:**  \n   - Options include OpenAI\u2019s GPT series, BERT-derived models (with a seq2seq head), or other open-source large models like Bloom or Llama.  \n   - Depending on the scenario, smaller, more efficient models might be used for privatized deployment.\n\n4. **Database/Knowledge Base:**  \n   - Graph databases: Neo4j, TigerGraph, etc.  \n   - Document databases: MongoDB, Elasticsearch (which can also serve as a retrieval engine).  \n   - Relational databases: MySQL or PostgreSQL (if structured note requirements are low, non-relational or graph databases might be more suitable).\n\n5. **Frontend and Interaction:**  \n   - Provide a voice input interface, either through a web or mobile application integrated with ASR.  \n   - Offer a UI for note search, recommendation, and automatic summarization.  \n   - Include a backend for privacy settings and permission management.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Example Workflow\n\n1. **User Creates a Note:**  \n   - The user inputs a note via voice or text; the system automatically recognizes and stores it in the database, and the GNN updates the corresponding node.\n\n2. **Automatic Note Tagging:**  \n   - The GNN performs an initial classification or clustering of the new note, recommending tags or topics.  \n   - The user can manually adjust the tags to further refine the model\u2019s performance.\n\n3. **Query and Summarization:**  \n   - The user inputs a query such as \u201cPlease summarize all meeting minutes about Project X.\u201d The retrieval module first filters out notes related to Project X.  \n   - The generation module then creates a concise summary based on the retrieved results and presents it to the user, possibly with links to the source notes.\n\n4. **Automatic Cleaning:**  \n   - Periodic analysis scripts use the GNN to calculate note activity or importance within the graph, and notes with low activity can be automatically archived or deleted.  \n   - Additionally, RAG may generate \u201chistorical archive reports\u201d for the user\u2019s review.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **GNN** is responsible for mining relationships, learning node representations, and performing automatic classification and recommendation on the note graph structure.  \n- **RAG** operates on the natural language layer to perform retrieval + generation, enabling AI-enhanced note summarization, key point extraction, and Q&A.  \n- The combination of these technologies allows for efficient management of inter-note relationships at the foundational level, while providing powerful intelligent summarization and search capabilities at the application level.  \n- With the addition of robust security and privacy strategies, the system ensures that note data is protected against leakage or misuse.\n\nBy following the above approach, one can effectively implement the functionalities depicted in the diagram\u2014**rapid note capture, AI enhancement, data security, efficient management, and automatic cleaning**. In actual deployment, the choice of technology stack and specific deployment strategy should be based on team size, hardware resources, and privacy requirements.",
