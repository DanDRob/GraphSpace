  "content": "Generating Commissions How do commissions work? Alpha generates revenue when a client transacts currency with us. On a monthly basis, a percentage of the total revenue generated by a portfolio manager (PM) is then paid to him/her. The percentage the PM earns is based on 2 things; the PM hitting their \u2018New Business\u2019 target and how long the PM has been at Alpha: What is 'New Business'? The revenue generated for Alpha when a client trades with Alpha for the first time is classified as 'New Business' revenue. Additionally, any revenue generated for Alpha by that client within 30 days of that first trade is also classified as 'New Business'. What is the 'New Business\u2019 target? The monthly 'New Business' target for PM\u2019s is set at \u00a36,000. It remains constant, not changing in line with the PM\u2019s experience or portfolio size. Over 90% of the time, when a client trades for the first time, the relative PM\u2019s \u2018New Business\u2019 target is hit. Having a monthly \u2018New Business\u2019 target that doesn\u2019t change ensures that there is no conflict of interest between a PM wanting to hit their \u2018New Business\u2019 target and the client being treated fairly. Worked examples The below tables show the average journey a PM goes on regarding total revenue generated in their first 3 years, the frequency \u2018New Business\u2019 targets are hit, and the commissions earnt. \u2022 Month 7 \u2013 The PM generates \u00a37,500 of revenue for Alpha and hits his/her new business target so earns \u00a31,800 (\u00a37,500 x 24%) of commission. \u2022 Month 11 \u2013 The PM generates \u00a337,500 of revenue for Alpha so earns \u00a34,500 (\u00a337,500 x 12%) of commission. \u2022 Month 14 \u2013 The PM generates \u00a353,500 of revenue for Alpha and hits his/her new business target so earns \u00a38,560 (\u00a353,500 x 16%) of commission.",
